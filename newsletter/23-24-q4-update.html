        <p>Thanks for a great year! This year has seen its fair share of ups and downs, but we made it. Now it's time to
          relax and enjoy some time off this summer.</p>

          Many thanks to Jose "Eddie" Nagore (top-right)! Eddie took it upon himself to write a letter to the TUSD
          Governing Board lamenting the security restrictions and lack of access to specialized software needed for
          software development. As a result, the Sofware and App Design programs throughout TUSD will have greater
          access to the tools and resources needed for the program.

        <h2>Intro class updates</h2>
        <p>Beginning classes are working to complete their final web app projects. We studied a lot of topics this year
          from block coding in Snap! to HTML/CSS and, finally, JavaScript. The final project this year was to create an
          original app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that did something "interesting". The platform we used to develop
          the projects with does not allow for students to publish their work, however, below are some screen recordings
          of student projects.</p>

        <h2>AP CS Principles</h2>
        <p>Second-year classes are wrapping up by taking advantage of the last opportunity to earn a certification this
          year. Students worked hard and attempted at least 3 out of the 4 exams that were offered. We had some issues
          with technology and scheduling certification tests but all students had at least one opportunity to earn an
          industry credential. </p>

              6 out of 7 testers (85%) sat for the AP exam. One had a scheduling conflict and we are working to schedule

        <p>
          The TSA (Technical Skills Assessment) is the exam required to officially pass the Software and App Design
          program. The AP exam offers an opportunity to earn a weighted GPA and earn college credit (dependent on exam
          score and the college). Certification exams offer the opportunity to earn industry recognized credentials
          which are accepted by potential employers as evidence of skills and experience. While all these exams overlap
          to some extent, they all required specific skills and knowledge. Any student passing multiple exams is very
          impressive.

        <h2>AP CS A</h2>
        <p>
          The advanced students wrapped up their year by taking the AP Computer Science A exam. <a
            href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/view-scores">Results will be available from College Board on
            July 8</a>. One student passed the <a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/Clients/IT-Specialist.aspx">Java
            IT-Specialist Java certification exam</a>. The curriculum we followed this year wasn't geared towards
          passing the IT-Specialist exam which makes passing it all the more impressive because that student had to
          dedicate time and effort outside of class time to prepare for the exam. Overall, it was a good group of
          students that worked hard to learn Java programming and I wish them luck.
