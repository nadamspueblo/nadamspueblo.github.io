          I can define a mainLoop() function that changes the position of elements on the screen using changeXBy() and
          changeYBy()<br>
          I can define a reset() function that resets the animated elements to their starting positions<br>
          I can write a conditional (if/else block) so the ball will reverse direction when it reaches the edge of the
          screen<br>
          I can define keydown and keyup functions and use addEventListener() to call the functions<br>
          I can use the isTouching() as a condition in an if-block to make the ball bounce off the paddle and blocks<br>
          I can use setTimeout() to call a function after a delay<br>
          I can use &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, and &lt;td&gt; to create a table and style it with CSS to create a grid
          of blocks
          I can create a CSS class to style multiple elements the same way<br>
          I can use the CSS properties position: absolute, top:, and left: to position an element on screen<br>
          I know the basic for-loop syntax<br>
          I can change the counter variable starting value and ending value in a for-loop<br>
          I can use the counter variable as part of the code inside a for-loop<br>
          I can use a for-loop to check if the ball is hitting any of the blocks in a level

          Students will submit coding assignments and answer a final, summative question at the end of each class
          period. Teacher will analyze assignments and responses to address issues the following class period as
          necessary.
