          I can identify the scope of a variable as global or local based on where it is declared<br>
          I can use math operations to write formulas using variables<br>
          I can identify the user input and output of the photo liker app<br>
          I can identify what data should be stored in variables for the photo liker app<br>
          I can determine when comparisons using &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, and == are true or false<br>
          I can use comparison operators to create a meaningful condition for an if block<br>
          I can use setImage() to change the source of an image element<br>
          I can use remove() to remove an element from the webpage<br>
          I can use an if-else block so that the value of the turn variable will alternate between "X" and "O" after
          each click on the tic-tac-toe board<br>
          I can use the "and" operator (&&) to write conditions that can be used to determine when there are three X's
          or O's in a row, column, or diagonal<br>
          I can use the "or" operator (||) to write a condition to determine when tic-tac-toe results in a draw<br>
          I can use the show(id) and hide(id) functions to show or hide HTML elements<br>
